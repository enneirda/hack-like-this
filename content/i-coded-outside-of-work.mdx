I would love to code in my free time a lot more than I actually do. I think about coding in my free time about 200x more than I actually do it. Something I do do in my free time is tutor ACT classes with a non-profit. I feel like I’m channeling my childhood dream of being a teacher. One of the things I like doing in the classroom is using sites like Kahoot to create games for my students. They LOVE the competition. And I do too! However, there are times when I conceptualize games that the limitations of these websites don’t allow me to create (or if they do they’re behind a paywall). 

Enter Engineering Adrienne. I often think “I can code! I can create what I want” Then I don’t. Until one day I did. I was trying to do some linking using Google SLides and it didn’t do what I wanted out of the box. So I made the ugliest app (but it works tho) to do what I wanted. All I wanted was 60 tiles in a grid that linked to different slides (a math question) that the tile represented. Maybe there’s a simpler way to do this than bootstrapping an ugly ass React app. I literally bootstrapped it (I used bootstrap for my UI). One of the biggest struggles for me with coding is designing! I often say, I write code, but I’m no designer. Give me a design to code, and I’ll make sure you can’t tell the difference between the mocks and the website. However, to come up with the designs myself? TUH.
