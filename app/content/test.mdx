summary: 'Explaining how I used Next.js, Tailwind and MDX to create minimalistic blog'
---

I have known I wanted to make a tech blog for a long time, but I never really got to it. It can be really hard to find time to code outside of work, but this year, I decided I wanted to be intentional about finding time to code outside of work.

## Choosing the Technologies
I have been using Next.js at work for about a year and a half now. In considering what technologies to use, I considered many factors:
- What am I trying to achieve? - I want this to be a tech blog that includes demos of the things that I create. I want to be as minimalistic as possible, content heavy, with the option to potentially expand in the futureWhat this means for me is that although right now, it is mostly frontend-leaning with mainly static content, I want to ensure that I have the capacity to easily add a backend to this website and possible dynamic content.
- How quickly do I want to get started? - Honestly, last year. I have wanted to do this for such a long time, and while I enjoy the learning and creating that comes with coding and want this blog to be a reflection of that, I also wanted to pick technologies without much of a learning curve that allow me to create content quickly. I'll reserve the learning curves for the content I'll blog about :)

With that, I landed on using Next.js and tailwind CSS. I'm using next because I have been using it for the past year and a half at my current full-time job, it abstracts away much of the devops things that cause getting started to be painful and allows me to jump right into code, and it allows me to easily add the things that support my future goals. It allows me the freedom I'm looking for while making it easy for me to just focus on making content and writing code when I need to.

For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS because I've been interested in learning it for a while, and the Next.js tutorial I spent two days doing (as well as many other next.js apps) uses it. It seems to be heavily promoted by next, as even when creating an app, they ask if you want to use it.  I spent two days going through the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) just to make sure I know everything I need to.

This post will be a collection of my notes and thoughts about the CSS ecosystem and the tools I'm currently using.

## Designing The UI
Give me a mock of the website you want to design, and I'll make sure you can't tell the difference between the mocks and the website. Ask me to create a website with zero design inspo, and I'll come up with the shittiest looking thing (but it will work though). That has been one of my biggest roadblocks to creating my own website. Writing frontend code in a corporate setting is so easy when you have something concrete to compare it to. To be honest, I hate having design freedom but that's not what we're here to talk about (maybe one day).

In searching for inspiration, I came upon [Lee Rob's portfolio](https://leerob.io/) that he created using the same technologies I was interested in. Next.js has such comprehensive documentation and many templates that can be utilized as "examples" when creating apps. At first I was going to use Lee Rob's example and work backwards but soon realized that I preferred to bootstrap my application from the boilerplate. I used

```js
npx create-next-app

```
